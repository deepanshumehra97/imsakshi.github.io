### Churn prediction on Telecom dataset

Telecom dataset used to predict churning was first wrangled using Pandas and then different scikit-learn
models were applied on the refined dataset .K-fold cross validation was used to suggest the best performing
model.Confusion matrix with and without normalization were also generated.<a href="https://github.com/imsakshi/ChurnPrediction">Github Repo</a> <br /> Skills: SCIKIT-LEARN,FLASK,PANDAS,NUMPY,MATPLOTLIB

### Predicting Loan Default

Built an ensemble of XGBoost and Gradient Boosting model to predict the customer default in a Bank.
Cleaned and analyzed the data and engineered new features using the insights obtained by analyzing the
data.<a href="https://github.com/imsakshi/Loan-Prediction---Analytics-Vidhya-hackathon">Github Repo</a><br />
